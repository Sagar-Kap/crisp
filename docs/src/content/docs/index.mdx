  <Card title="Enforce Standardardised Rules" icon="document">
    Enforce rules for authoring Git commit message which are legible and follows a
    standardised practice. The rules are based on the
    [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specifications and is
    heavily inspired from the [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) project.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built With Go" icon="seti:go">
    Crisp is built with the [Go](https://go.dev) programming language for speed,
    efficiency and ease of usage/distribution as a coompiled executable binary.
  </Card>
  <Card title="First Class Support for Git Hooks" icon="seti:git">
    Crisp provides first-class support for
    [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) with the help of the
    [Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com) framework. Check out the
    "[Getting Started](/crisp/usage-guide#pre-commit-hook)" section of the
    documentation for more instructions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy to Configure" icon="seti:config">
    Unlike its alternative (especially [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org)) is
    extremely easy to configure requiring only knowledge of JSON, TOML or YAML!
    Thanks to [Go](https://go.dev) and the
    [`spf13/viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper) package you no longer have to
    deal with a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) runtime just to run a linter for
    commit messages.
